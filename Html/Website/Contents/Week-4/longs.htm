				<h2>Longs Peak Online Trail Map</h2>

				<p>
					At 14,255 feet, Longs Peak towers above all other summits in Rocky Mountain 
					National Park. The summer is the only season in which the peak can be climbed 
					by a non-technical route. Early mornings break calm, clouds build in the 
					afternoon sky, often exploding in storms of brief, heavy rain, thunder and 
					dangerous lightning. Begin your hike early, way before dawn, to be back below 
					timberline before the weather turns for the worse.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The Keyhole Route, Longs Peak's only non-technical hiking pathway, is a 16 
					mile round trip with an elevation gain of 4,850 feet. Though non-technical, 
					the Keyhole Route is still challenging and is not recommended for those who 
					are afraid of heights or exposed ledges. Hikers should be properly outfitted 
					with clothing, food and water. Use caution when ascending or descending steep 
					areas. Don't be afraid to back down when bad weather threatens.
				</p>

					Move your mouse pointer over the numbered landmarks in the map to preview the hike.
